Two options: gzipped tarball, or (Windows-style zip)

First, place all files in a directory named (e.g.) "smith". Make sure you are in the parent directory of smith.

1) gzipped tarball

(to create archive, c means create)
bash$ tar cvzf smith.tgz smith

(to see contents of archive, t means titles)
bash$ tar tzf smith.tgz

(to extract contents of archive, x means extract)
bash$ tar xvzf smith.tgz


2) Windows-style zip:

(create, file is named smith.zip)
bash$ zip -r smith smith 

(extract)
bash$ unzip smith.zip
